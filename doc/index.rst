===================================

Introduction
------------
`sastool` is a Python package containing tools useful for small-angle scattering.
While this package was written firstly with X-rays in mind, it can be applied to
neutron scattering experiments and simulations as well.

The package consists of lower  (such as input-output of various
scattering file formats and operations on the data) and higher level utilities.
